🚀 Just Built a Group Messaging Application using Java + Socket Programming! 💬

I’m excited to share my latest project — a lightweight yet powerful Group Chat App that demonstrates the fundamentals of networking and concurrency using Java Sockets and multithreading.

🛠️ Key Features:

* Real-time group messaging
* Server-client architecture
* Handles multiple users concurrently using threads
* Custom console-based UI for simplicity
* Clean and modular Java code

📌 Tech Stack:

* Java (Core + Networking)
* Socket Programming (TCP)
* Multithreading

🔍 This project helped me understand how low-level networking works behind the scenes — from connection management to message broadcasting across clients.

💡 Ideal for:

* Students learning Java networking
* Beginners exploring backend communication logic
* Anyone curious about how chat systems function

🧠 Up next: integrating a GUI using **Java Swing** and eventually exploring **WebSocket** integration for browser-based clients.
